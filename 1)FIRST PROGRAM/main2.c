there are 32 general keywords in C programming lang(CPL)
we cannot make function/variable/constant/ any identifier bcz these words are reserved by C programming lang(CPL)
punctuation characters like @ $ % etc are not allowed in CPL
CPL is a case sensitive programming lang bcz First and first are different variables for CPL..(but in HTML they are same )
to make readable program we write things till ; in one line
to make program in C we use "keywords".."identifier".."symbols".."constants".."string-literal"
